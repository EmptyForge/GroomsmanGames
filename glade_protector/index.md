# Oops!

## I used the Alpha release of Godot4 for this game!

### And I didn't check beforehand to confirm that this alpha version of the engine could build for web5!

#### And it turns out it doesn't!

##### So eventually this game will be here when the engine is updated....

# But for now, your game can be downloaded and unzipped from [here](https://github.com/T3chedOut/GroomsmanGames/releases/download/1.0/GladeProtector.zip)!
